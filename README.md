This is based on LM75 work of Diego Barrios Romero

This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the LM73 temperature sensor
and thermal watchdog, based on the
[`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.


This driver allows you to:
- Enable/disable the device.
- Read the temperature.

## The device
The LM73 temperature sensor includes a delta-sigma analog-to-digital
converter, and a digital overtemperature detector. The host can
query the LM73 through its I2C interface to read temperature at any
time. 

Datasheet:
- [LM73](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm73.pdf)

### Usage

```rust
extern crate linux_embedded_hal as hal;
extern crate lm73;

use hal::I2cdev;
use lm73::{ Lm73, SlaveAddr };

fn main() {
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let address = SlaveAddr::default();
    let mut sensor = Lm73::new(dev, address);
    let temp_celsius = sensor.read_temperature().unwrap();
    println!("Temperature: {}ÂºC", temp_celsius);
}
```
